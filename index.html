 <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Student in the University Bina Nusantara International, and I am currently on my 4th semester. During my time, I learned how to code in Python, Java, C++, HTML and Javascript </p>
<h3>past projects: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>The first project I ever worked on was a remake of the game Tetris in Python, it was done in pygame and plays exactly like the real Tetris does</li>
    <li>In the 2nd semester I worked on another project, which was a shop database in MS Access which I had linked to Java to create a shop simulation</li>
    <li>The last thing I worked on was an idle NFT game that uses blockchain technology to be played, although the coding was mostly done by my groupmates</li>
</ul>
